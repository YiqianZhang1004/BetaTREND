Description: Implements a unified toolkit for analysing the relationship between
    continuous host traits and microbial beta diversity.  Functions include:
    (i) gradient projection of traits onto PCoA space with publication-quality
    visualisation; (ii) trustworthiness / continuity / Mantel diagnostics;
    (iii) CJTT-U trend test with analytic, jackknife and bootstrap variance
    options plus permutation p-values, with optional double residualisation for
    confounders; and (iv) G-C-O structural decomposition classifying samples as
    Gradient-driven, Cluster-driven, or Outliers.  Designed for rapid,
    reproducible microbiome analyses.
